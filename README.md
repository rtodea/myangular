# *my*angular
Because:
 * understanding the fundamentals of anything is hard
 * others have done a good job already

we are following the instructions from Terro Parviainen's
[book](https://vk.com/doc200673201_437264093?hash=52af73b50e55295ed4&dl=feb3b3a310863dc390)
and github [repository](https://github.com/teropa/build-your-own-angularjs/)
with a little twist of our own:

1. Gulp instead of Grunt
2. ES6 features
3. Mocha instead of Jasmine
